# Youetal2025
Version of the code used in You et al (2025), Nature Communications. This version includes the model flavour reltransCpF, which outputs a lag vs frequency spectrum between two given energy bands. The code was branched from older versions of reltrans, so is kept in a separate repository for version control reasons.
